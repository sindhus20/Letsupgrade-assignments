            <b>Java</b> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language 
            that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
            developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java 
            code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for 
            recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
            that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
            computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer 
            low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
            (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional 
            compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according 
            to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
